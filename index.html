            Subhash Chandra Bose's birthday is on the 23rd of January 1897, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was born in Cuttack.
             He was born to Janakinath Bose and Prabhavati Dutt. He was an Indian nationalist in the era of British colonialism 
             in India whose defiant patriotism and immovable nerve and bravery made him a national hero whose praises are still 
             sung with pride by every Indian citizen. His attempts to get rid of the British with the help of the Nazi party 
             and Imperial Japan during the time of the second world war left him a troubled legacy. Although every Indian
            feels proud by hearing his name, it was not the case during the freedom struggle, especially in the INC where he 
            often faced clashes of ideologies with Gandhiji and he did not get the recognition that he deserved. Let us take a
            look into the life of this extraordinary yet unsung hero. In honour of his contribution to the freedom struggle 
            recently it was announced that his birthday is celebrated as “PARAKRAM DIWAS” as “parakram” translates to courage 
            in English thereby recognizing his immense contribution by calling his birthday the day of courage. The day will
            now be commemorated each year in memory of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, the unsung hero of the Indian independence 
            struggle!  Let us look at the Subhash Chandra Bose Biography and know our hero, in and out!

            <h2>Role in Freedom Struggle</h2>
            <hr>
            </br>
            <p>
            Subhas Chandra Bose joined the Indian National Congress (INC) under the influence of Mahatma Gandhi and
             started the newspapers called “Swaraj” which means self-governance which marks his entry into politics
              and his role in the freedom struggle in India has just started. Chittaranjan Das was his mentor.
               In the year 1923, he became the President of the All India Youth Congress and became the editor of 
               the newspaper “Forward” started by C.R. Das himself. He had also been elected as the mayor of Calcutta
                back then. He gained leadership spirit and made his way up to the top in the INC very soon.
            He was sent to jail in 1930 during the Civil Disobedience movement but was related along with other
             prominent leaders in the year 1931 when the Gandhi-Irwin pact was signed. He maintained strict standards during the 
              commencement of the first World War and demanded full independence of India from the British within six months. 
              He faced vehement objections from inside the Congress which led him to resign from INC and form a more
               progressive group called the “Forward Bloc”. 
             He started a mass movement against using Indian men in the wars of foreign countries which received immense
             support and voice which led him to be put under house arrest in Calcutta but he left the house in disguise in
              January 1941 and reached Germany via Afghanistan and met the Nazi leader there to seek help from them to
               drive the British away from India. He also sought help from Japan. He made full use of the philosophy 
               “an enemy's enemy is a friend”.
            </p>

               <h2>Disappearence</h2>
               <hr>
              </br>
            In July 1943, he arrived in Singapore and took over the reins of the Indian Independence Movement started by 
            Rash Behari Bose and organized the Azad Hind Fauj which is also known as the Indian National Army. It was at
             this time he was hailed as “Netaji” by which he is commonly referred to even today. The next few events have 
             been blurry in the history of their struggle for independence by him. The INA liberated the Andaman and Nicobar
              islands but when it reached Burma, bad weather conditions, as well as the defeat of Japan and Germany in the Second
               World War, forced him to retreat. He is rumoured to have been killed in a plane crash in Taipei, Taiwan on August
                18, 1945. Even though it is widely believed that he was still alive for many years after that.
